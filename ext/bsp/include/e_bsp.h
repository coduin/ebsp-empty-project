/**
 * @file e_bsp.h
 * @brief All BSP core functions for the Epiphany cores.
 *
 * This file contains all BSP core functions.
 *
 * ## BSP Message Passing functions
 * Every message contains a fixed-length (can change per superstep)
 * tag and a variable-length payload.
 * Default tag-size is zero unless the host has sent messages
 * and used ebsp_set_tagsize.
 * Note that the order of receiving messages is not guaranteed to correspond
 * to the order in which they were sent.
 *
 * Before the first sync, the queue contains messages from the ARM host
 * They are invalidated after the first call to bsp_sync().
